# fiber-go-app

- [go modules](https://blog.golang.org/migrating-to-go-modules) (stable since v1.14)
- [gofiber/fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber)
- https://github.com/cosmtrek/air for live-reload

**TODO: look at https://github.com/gofiber/recipes for examples**

### Dev

```bash
# to start hot reloading server
$ chmod +x air
$ ./air
```

### go modules

To add a dep, simply include it in any source file.

`go get _` to force upgrade dependency

`go mod -v all` to update all deps

`go mod tidy` to prune deps in `go.mod`

`go mod vendor` copy installed deps to `/vendor`

### Libs being considered

- https://github.com/dominikh/go-tools for more static analysis
- use https://github.com/tarent/loginsrv if it had support for 2FA/TOTP...
  - probably just use https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-go

### DB Libs

- **[ent](https://github.com/facebook/ent) - seems promising...**

there are no great ORM libs in go:

> ORM requires a very framework oriented development style, which Go is not particularly geared toward lacking both generics and dynamic class loader. It doesn't fit particularly well with Go's focus on simplicity and performance, either. - https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/b9h8xo/the_state_of_orms_in_2019/

- ~~[jmoiron/sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) - raw sql strings~~
- [dbr](https://github.com/gocraft/dbr) - inspired by `sqlx` and `Squirrel`

* gorm - heavy, raw sql, magic struct annotation literals
* xorm - similar to gorm
* ~~https://github.com/go-reform/reform - unclear docs on how to do joins/order/etc.~~
* upper/db - ?

* on the other hand could use a code generator like https://github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler or Prisma (go client)

SQL migrations - https://github.com/golang-migrate/sql-migrate --> there's no "generation migration on model change" tools, but this will at least automatically run all your migration files per a file naming convention
